    # Making this fixture I realized a lot of things.
    # first, if we use timedelta, everyone will get different dates from different times.
    # For example, today is 7th day of the week and tomorrow starts a new week.
    # There is no way for deltatime() to know if we started a new week or not.
    # some people will get extra week streaks and others will not get any.
    
    # writing hardcoded timestamps will not be consistent either. 
    
    # preferrably our habits should align with calendar dynamically because
    # our work and life arrangements also aligns with calendar dates like our usual off days.
    
    # so in order to keep consistent result by making it dynamic,
    # I created the function as follow:
    
    # --- Date Setup ---
    now = datetime.now()
    current_year = now.year

    # Helper to get dates from previous months, handling year change from January
    def get_past_month(months_ago):
        month = now.month - months_ago
        year = current_year
        while month <= 0:
            month += 12
            year -= 1

    two_months_ago_year, two_months_ago_month = get_past_month(2)
