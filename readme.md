## Demo in Action

Hereâ€™s a quick look at what you can do with the Habit Tracker CLI, using the built-in demo environment.

- First, start the demo environment to create and seed the demo database
```bash
$ habit demo start
Creating new demo database...
Loading fixtures...
Fixtures loaded successfully.
```
- Get a high-level summary of the demo data
```bash
$ habit demo analyze --show summary
--- Habit Summary ---
Total Registered Habits: 15

Periodicity Breakdown:
- Daily (Completed / Total):   3 / 8
- Weekly (Completed / Total):  3 / 5
- Monthly (Completed / Total): 1 / 2

Performance Highlights:
- Best Performing Habit: Pay Monthly Bills
- Most Struggled Habit:  Weekly Review
---------------------
```
- Checkoff a habit in the demo
```bash
$ habit demo checkoff "Workout"
Successfully checked off habit: 'Workout'. Keep it up!
```
- See the struggle scores for all habits
```bash
$ habit demo analyze --show struggle
--- Habit Struggle Score (Higher is worse) ---
  - Weekly Review: Score 63 (2 breaks, 61 gap days)
  - Water the Plants: Score 42 (1 breaks, 41 gap days)
  - Call Family or Friends: Score 30 (1 breaks, 29 gap days)
  - Submit Timesheet: Score 21 (1 breaks, 20 gap days)
  # ... and so on
